- **Basic Information**:
  - **Type**: Select the type of the tool. `Shared` tools can have methods or variables that are available on the whole lifecycle of the flow (for example a simple record acting as a database).
  - **Name**: Enter a unique name for the tool (e.g., `new_tool`).
  - **Description**: Provide a brief description of the tool's purpose.
  !!! note
      The tool name should match the function name in the code.

- ***Content Section***:
  - This is where you define the code for your tool
  - **Template Code**:
    - Replace the provided template code with your actual implementation.
    - Ensure that the function name matches the tool's name (e.g., if the tool is named `new_tool`, the function should also be named `new_tool`).
  - Example:
  
      ```python
        """
        Replace this with your code.
        Ensure the function name matches the tool name.
        """
        def new_tool() -> None:
            """Tool entry point."""
            # Add your logic here
      ```

- **Advanced tab**:
  - Here you can handle advanced parameters for the tool like:
  - ***Environment Variables***:
    - Add any necessary environment variables as key-value pairs to support the tool.
    - Click the **+** button to add multiple environment variables if required.
  - ***Requirements***:
    - If the tool requires aditional packages to be installed you can add them here.

- **Save the Configuration**:
  - Once you have entered the tool details and code, click **Save** to confirm and apply the tool configuration.

This setup enables you to define and configure a new tool within your project by providing necessary code, naming conventions, and any environment variables.
