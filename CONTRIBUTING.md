# Contributing to Waldiez Projects

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our projects! This document outlines the guidelines for contributing to Waldiez projects, including how to report issues, submit code changes, and adhere to our code of conduct.

## [Project Specific Guidelines]

This project consists of two parts:

- A **Python package**, located in the `waldiez` folder, built using [`hatch`](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/)
- A **TypeScript (React) library and web application**, located in the `src` folder, built using [`bun`](https://bun.sh/)

## 🐍 Contributing to the Python Part (`waldiez/`)

The Python backend is a package managed primarily using [Hatch](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/), with optional support for [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv) and plain `venv`.

---

### 🚀 Quick Setup (Recommended: Hatch)

1. Install Hatch:

    ```shell
    pip install hatch
    ```

2. Create the dev environment:

    ```shell
    hatch env create
    hatch shell
    ```

3. All optional dependencies are managed via extras (`dev`, `test`, `docs`, etc.), and available via:

    ```shell
    hatch run pip list
    ```

---

### ⚡ Alternative: Fast Setup with `uv`

1. Install uv:

    ```shell
    pip install uv
    ```

2. Create and activate an environment:

    ```shell
    uv venv --python 3.12
    source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
    ```

3. Install extras:

    ```shell
    uv pip install '.[dev,test,docs]'
    ```

---

### 🔧 Alternative: Plain Python with `venv` and `requirements/`

This project also supports traditional requirements-based setup:

1. Create a virtualenv:

    ```shell
    python -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate   # Windows: .venv\\Scripts\\activate
    ```

2. Install dependencies:

    ```shell
    pip install -r requirements/all.txt
    # or (to manually select what you need):
    pip install -r requirements/dev.txt
    pip install -r requirements/test.txt
    pip install -r requirements/docs.txt
    ```

> If using this method, you won’t have access to Hatch’s `hatch run` commands. Instead, use:
>
> python scripts/lint.py
> python scripts/test.py
> python scripts/format.py
> python scripts/build.py
>

Or you prefer make, you can use `make` commands:

```shell
Usage: make [target]

Default target: help

Targets:
 help             Show this message and exit
 requirements     Generate requirements/*.txt files
 format           Run the formatters for the python package
 lint             Run the linters for the python package
 forlint          Alias for 'format' and 'lint'
 clean            Cleanup unneeded files
 test             Run the tests for the python package
 test-models      Run the tests for the models
 test-exporting   Run the tests for exporting
 test-running     Run the tests for running
 test-io          Run the tests for the IO stream
 build            Build the python package
 docs             Generate the python documentation
 docs-live        Generate the documentation in 'live' mode
 images           Build the podman/docker images
 some             Run some (not all) of the above
```

---

### 🧪 Testing (Python)

To run all tests with full coverage reports:

```shell
hatch run test
```

To run only selected test modules:

```shell
hatch run test-models
hatch run test-exporting
hatch run test-io
```

To test against multiple Python versions (3.10–3.13):

```shell
hatch run matrix-test
```

---

### 🧹 Formatting & Linting (Python)

To auto-format everything:

```shell
hatch run format
```

To run all linters:

```shell
hatch run lint
```

This runs: `black`, `ruff`, `mypy`, `flake8`, `bandit`, `pylint`, `yamllint`

---

### 📦 Build & Release (Python)

To generate build artifacts:

```shell
hatch run build
```

To generate the documentation:

> Note: For the "full" documentation (and the React related parts), we should first generate the React related md files using `bun docs`.
> Then, we can generate the full documentation using:

```shell
hatch run docs
```

To run all checks, matrix tests, docs, build:

```shell
hatch run all
```

---

## ⚛️ Contributing to the React Part (`src/`)

The React frontend is a TypeScript project built with [Bun](https://bun.sh/), and [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). It includes integrated support for Monaco editor, Playwright browser testing, Vitest, and full lint/style/format scripts.

---

### 🧰 Prerequisites

- Node.js 22.x or later
- Bun v1.2.11 or later

---

### 🚀 Setup

1. Clone the repository if not already done:

    ```shell
    git clone https://github.com/waldiez/waldiez.git -b dev
    cd waldiez
    ```

2. Install the dependencies:

    ```shell
    bun install
    ```

---

### 🧪 Development (React)

Start the dev server:

```shell
bun dev
```

This runs `bun monaco && vite` and launches the app at:

```shell
http://localhost:5173
```

---

### 🧹 Formatting & Linting (React)

To check and fix code style:

```shell
bun format
```

This runs:

- `prettier`
- `stylelint`
- `eslint --fix`

To check only (no changes):

```shell
bun lint
```

Or do both:

```shell
bun forlint
```

---

### 🧪 Testing (React)

Run all tests (components + browser):

```shell
bun test
```

Run just unit/component tests:

```shell
bun test:components
```

Run browser tests (Playwright required):

```shell
bun test:browser
```

Update UI snapshots:

```shell
bun test:snapshots
```

Run tests with coverage:

```shell
bun test:coverage
```

---

### 📦 Build (React)

Full build pipeline (library + web app + archive):

```shell
bun run build
```

Build documentation (this will only generate the React related md files in `docs/reference/react`):

```shell
bun docs
```

Preview build output:

```shell
bun preview
```

---

### 🔧 Cleaning (React)

Clean all outputs (builds, coverage, tsbuildinfo, etc.):

```shell
bun clean
```

You can also run partial cleaning scripts:

- `bun clean:lintcache`
- `bun clean:dist`
- `bun clean:coverage`
- `bun clean:web`
- `bun clean:docs`
- `bun clean:archive`

---

### 🔗 Combined Project Pipeline

You can run the full project build pipeline (React + Python) using the unified helpers:

```shell
# or ./scripts/do.{sh,ps1} all
python do.py all
# or:
node --import=tsx do.ts all  # or npx tsx do.ts all
```

This will:

- Format, lint, and test the React project
- Build the React frontend and archive
- Format, lint, and test the Python package
- Build the Python wheel/sdist
- Build documentation
- Build a Docker image with the python package

---

### ✅ Submitting Changes

1. Ensure lint and tests pass:

    ```shell
    # either on the react part:
    bun format
    bun lint
    bun test
    bun schema
    # or on the python part:
    hatch run format
    hatch run lint
    hatch run test
    # or the make/python way:
    make forlint
    make test
    ```

2. Optionally (but recommended) ensure everything (Python + React) is working:

    ```shell
    # or ./scripts/do.{sh,ps1} all
    ./do all
    ```

3. Commit and push:

    ```shell
    git commit -m "feat: my feature"
    git push origin feature/my-feature
    ```

4. Open a pull request targeting the `dev` branch.
